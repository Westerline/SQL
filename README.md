# Batch Scripting Repository

The purpose of this repository is to organize useful batch snippets, functions, scripts, and templates. These items are particularly helpful where PowerShell isn't available; or where a quick, automated solution is required.

## Getting Started

Borrow from these items as required to create your own batch scripts.

### Prerequisites

*Windows-based Operating System
*Text Editor with Syntax Highlighting Such as Notepad++ (Optional)

### Coding/Indentation Style

*Any comment-based help should be located towards the top of the document. These comments should focus on items which aren't included in Microsoft's help system for CMD.
*Comments should be written as complete sentences.
*The first letter of commands should be capitalized
*GNU style is adopted for indentation, refer to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indentation_style#GNU_style for more details.

finalthing();
```
